          “The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human
          understanding. <wbr />Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny
          planetary home. <wbr />
          In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even
          petty. <wbr />And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows
          much promise. <wbr />In the last few millennia we have made the most
          astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place
          within it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider. <wbr />They
          remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a
          joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. <wbr />
          I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which
          we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.”
