          “The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding.
          <wbr> Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home.<wbr>
          In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty.
          <wbr> And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise.<wbr>  
					In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider.<wbr> 
					They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival.<wbr>
					I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.”
